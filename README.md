# The missing GitLab build radiator view

## Introduction

```gitlab-radiator``` is a small Node.js application for serving a [Jenkins Radiator View](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Radiator+View+Plugin) inspired web view of your team's CI pipelines fetched from a GitLab CI installation running locally or remotely.

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/heikkipora/gitlab-radiator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heikkipora/gitlab-radiator)

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js v5.0.0 or newer
- A modern web browser
- An account in https://gitlab.com or an onsite installation of the [GitLab software package](https://about.gitlab.com/products).

## Installation

    npm install -g gitlab-radiator

## Usage

Create a configuration file (see [Configuration](#configuration) below) and run:

    gitlab-radiator

And if you have an onsite GitLab with HTTPS and self-signed certificates:

    NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 gitlab-radiator

You might prefer providing the CA file location in configuration instead of totally disabling TLS certificate checking.

Then navigate with a browser to http://localhost:3000 - or whatever port you did configure.

## Configuration

```gitlab-radiator``` looks for its mandatory configuration file at ```~/.gitlab-radiator.yml``` by default.
It can be overridden by defining the ```GITLAB_RADIATOR_CONFIG``` environment variable.

Mandatory configuration properties:

- ```gitlabs / url``` - Root URL of your GitLab installation - or that of GitLab SaaS CI
- ```gitlabs / access-token``` - A GitLab access token for allowing access to the GitLab API. One can be generated with GitLab's UI under Profile Settins / Personal Access Tokens. The value can alternatively be defined as `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

Example yaml syntax:

```
gitlabs:
  -
    access-token: 12invalidtoken12
    url: https://gitlab.com
```

Optional configuration properties:

- ```gitlabs / projects / include``` - Regular expression for inclusion of projects. Default is to include all projects.
- ```gitlabs / projects / exclude``` - Regular expression for exclusion of projects. Default is to exclude no projects.
- ```gitlabs / projects / excludePipelineStatus``` - Array of pipeline statuses, that should be excluded (i.e. hidden) (available statuses are ```running, pending, success, failed, canceled, skipped```).
- ```gitlabs / projects / maxNonFailedJobsVisible``` - Number of non-failed jobs visible for a stage at maximum. Helps with highly concurrent project pipelines becoming uncomfortably high. Default values is unlimited.
- ```gitlabs / auth / username``` - Enables HTTP basic authentication with the defined username and password.
- ```gitlabs / auth / password``` - Enables HTTP basic authentication with the defined username and password.
- ```gitlabs / caFile``` - CA file location to be passed to the request library when accessing the gitlab instance.
- ```gitlabs / ignoreArchived``` - Ignore archived projects. Default value is `true`
- ```groupSuccessfulProjects``` - If set to `true` projects with successful pipeline status are grouped by namespace. Projects with other pipeline statuses are still rendered seperately. Default value is `false`.
- ```projectsOrder``` - Array of project attributes to use for sorting projects. Default value is ```['name']``` (available attributes are ```status, name, id, nameWithoutNamespace, group```).
- ```interval``` - Number of seconds between updateing projects and pipelines from GitLabs. Default value is 10 seconds.
- ```port``` - HTTP port to listen on. Default value is 3000.
- ```zoom``` - View zoom factor (to make your projects fit a display nicely). Default value is 1.0
- ```columns``` - Number of columns to display (to fit more projects on screen). Default value is 1
- ```colors``` - Define some custom colors. Available colors `success, failed, running, light-text, background, project-background, group-background, error-message-text, error-message-background
` (you may have a look at `/public/colors.less`, the colorNames from config will replace value for `@<colorname>-color` less variable)

Example yaml syntax:

```
gitlabs:
  -
    access-token: 12invalidtoken12
    url: https://gitlab.com
    projects:
      exclude: .*/.*-inactive-project
      excludePipelineStatus: ['canceled', 'pending']
      maxNonFailedJobsVisible: 3
    auth:
          username: 'radiator'
      password: 'p455w0rd'
projectsOrder: ['status', 'name']
interval: 30
port: 8000
zoom: 0.85
columns: 4
colors:
  success: 'rgb(0,255,0)'
```

## Changelog

See [releases](https://github.com/heikkipora/gitlab-radiator/releases).

## Breaking changes from 2.x to 3.0

- Configuration file syntax has changed so that you now can define multiple gitlab instances to poll from. 
E.g. polling from https://gitlab.com and from your own hosted https://gitlab.yourdomain.com instance of gitlab.
Unfortunately all existing configurations for single gitlab polling have to be adjusted slightly.
-  Also config param `order` has moved from `projects.order` to global `projectsOrder`, as the order has effect on all projects and not per gitlab config.

## Breaking changes from 1.x to 2.0

- Configuration file syntax has changed so that there's only a single ```interval``` property instead of two nested ones.

Pull requests are welcome. Kindly check that your code passes ESLint checks by running ```npm run eslint``` first.
Integration tests are (for now) skipped for pull request builds on Travis as they depend on a secret API token.
